It integrates the total amount of substance (called amount of solution), heat, charge, entropy, volume and others from each substances to present the base properties such as temperature, pressure, electric potential and others. The usage is very simple - just connect each chemical substance with its chemical solution using their <a href=\"modelica://Chemical.Interfaces.SolutionPort\">SolutionPort</a>.</p></td>

<td valign=\"middle\"><p><a href=\"modelica://Chemical.Components.Reaction\">Chemical reaction</a></p><p>The chemical reaction component is very general. The dissociation constant of the equilibrium is calculated from substance properties at usual in thermodynamics, for example as definition of <a href=\"http://goldbook.iupac.org/S05915.html\">UIPAC</a>. For example if we want to define <a href=\"modelica://Chemical.Examples.SimpleReaction\">simple reaction A&LT;-&GT;B</a> with dissociation constant [B]/[A]=2 then it must be the difference between Gibbs energies of formation equal to B.DfG - A.DfG = - R * T * ln(2). Without lost of generality it is possible to select some substances as reference and give them the zero Gibbs energy of formation. The next substances created by some chemical process can be expressed from them such as example of <a href=\"modelica://Chemical.Examples.Hemoglobin.Allosteric_Hemoglobin_MWC\">alosteric hemoglobin</a> calculation. The kinetics of the chemical reaction is different as usual. However the most of processes can be recalculated with sufficient precision, for example the <a href=\"Chemical.Examples.MichaelisMenten\">Michaelic-Menton</a> can be recalculated with precision of 1.5&percnt; of maximal rate. </p></td>

Analogically as in chemical reaction the speed of diffucion can be calculated as coefficient C multiplied by electro-chemical gratient. C can be a parammeter or input expressed from distance, substance and solution properties. </p></td>

The most of problems in data is caused by wrong selection of standard state as 1 mol/kg or 1 mol/L. Please avoid these assumptions of these totally confused states and use only mole fractions instead of each molality or molarity - the world will be much better (I promise). </p></td>

A result is the Donnan&apos;s equilibrium, Nernst potentials of the ions and the membrane electric potential. Transporting water through membrane is reaching the osmotic equilibrium (The real one, not the simplified one defined by osmotic pressure lineary dependent on impermeable substance concentration). </p></td>

For example the hemoglobin is tetramer, which can be in two conformation: relaxed and tensed. In each of this conformation it has different afinities (different dissociation constant) for binding oxygen in each of four independent subunits. This alosteric effect can be modeled using speciation such as in <a href=\"modelica://Chemical.Examples.Hemoglobin.Allosteric_Hemoglobin2_MWC\">Allosteric_Hemoglobin2_MWC</a>.

<p><font style=\"font-size: 10pt; \">This section contains questions/answer to users and/or distributors of Modelica packages and/or documents under Modelica License 2. Note, the answers to the questions below are not a legal interpretation of the Modelica License 2. In case of a conflict, the language of the license shall prevail. </p>
<p><b></font><font style=\"color: #008000; \">Using or Distributing a Modelica <u>Package</u> under the Modelica License 2</font></b> </p>
<p><b><font style=\"font-size: 10pt; \">What are the main differences to the previous version of the Modelica License?</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Modelica License 1 is unclear whether the licensed Modelica package can be distributed under a different license. Version 2 explicitly allows that &ldquo;Derivative Work&rdquo; can be distributed under any license of Your choice, see examples in Section 1d) as to what qualifies as Derivative Work (so, version 2 is clearer). </li>
<li>If You modify a Modelica package under Modelica License 2 (besides fixing of errors, adding vendor specific Modelica annotations, using a subset of the classes of a Modelica package, or using another representation, e.g., a binary representation), you must rename the root-level name of the package for your distribution. In version 1 you could keep the name (so, version 2 is more restrictive). The reason of this restriction is to reduce the risk that Modelica packages are available that have identical names, but different functionality. </li>
<li>Modelica License 1 states that &ldquo;It is not allowed to charge a fee for the original version or a modified version of the software, besides a reasonable fee for distribution and support&rdquo;. Version 2 has a similar intention for all Original Work under <u>Modelica License 2</u> (to remain free of charge and open source) but states this more clearly as &ldquo;No fee, neither as a copyright-license fee, nor as a selling fee for the copy as such may be charged&rdquo;. Contrary to version 1, Modelica License 2 has no restrictions on fees for Derivative Work that is provided under a different license (so, version 2 is clearer and has fewer restrictions). </li>
<li>Modelica License 2 introduces several useful provisions for the licensee (articles 5, 6, 12), and for the licensor (articles 7, 12, 13, 14) that have no counter part in version 1. </li>
<li>Modelica License 2 can be applied to all type of work, including documents, images and data files, contrary to version 1 that was dedicated for software only (so, version 2 is more general). </li>
</ol>
<h4>Can I distribute a Modelica package (under Modelica License 2) as part of my commercial Modelica modeling and simulation environment?</h4>
<p>Yes, according to Section 2c). However, you are not allowed to charge a fee for this part of your environment. Of course, you can charge for your part of the environment. </p>
<h4>Can I distribute a Modelica package (under Modelica License 2) under a different license?</h4>
<p>No. The license of an unmodified Modelica package cannot be changed according to Sections 2c) and 2d). This means that you cannot <u>sell</u> copies of it, any distribution has to be free of charge. </p>
<h4>Can I distribute a Modelica package (under Modelica License 2) under a different license when I first encrypt the package?</h4>
<p>No. Merely encrypting a package does not qualify for Derivative Work and therefore the encrypted package has to stay under Modelica License 2. </p>
<h4>Can I distribute a Modelica package (under Modelica License 2) under a different license when I first add classes to the package?</h4>
<p>No. The package itself remains unmodified, i.e., it is Original Work, and therefore the license for this part must remain under Modelica License 2. The newly added classes can be, however, under a different license. </p>
<p><b>Can I copy a class out of a Modelica package (under Modelica License 2) and include it <u>unmodified</u> in a Modelica package under a <u>commercial/proprietary license</u>?</b></p>
<p>No, according to article 2c). However, you can include model, block, function, package, record and connector classes in your Modelica package under <u>Modelica License 2</u>. This means that your Modelica package could be under a commercial/proprietary license, but one or more classes of it are under Modelica License 2.</p>
<p>Note, a &ldquo;type&rdquo; class (e.g., type Angle = Real(unit=&rdquo;rad&rdquo;)) can be copied and included unmodified under a commercial/proprietary license (for details, see the next question). </p>
<p><b>Can I copy a type class or <u>part</u> of a model, block, function, record, connector class, out of a Modelica package (under Modelica License 2) and include it modified or unmodified in a Modelica package under a <u>commercial/proprietary</u> license</b></p>
<p>Yes, according to article 2d), since this will in the end usually qualify as Derivative Work. The reasoning is the following: A type class or part of another class (e.g., an equation, a declaration, part of a class description) cannot be utilized &ldquo;by its own&rdquo;. In order to make this &ldquo;usable&rdquo;, you have to add additional code in order that the class can be utilized. This is therefore usually Derivative Work and Derivative Work can be provided under a different license. Note, this only holds, if the additional code introduced is sufficient to qualify for Derivative Work. Merely, just copying a class and changing, say, one character in the documentation of this class would be no Derivative Work and therefore the copied code would have to stay under Modelica License 2. </p>
<p><b>Can I copy a class out of a Modelica package (under Modelica License 2) and include it in <u>modified </u>form in a <u>commercial/proprietary</u> Modelica package?</b></p>
<p>Yes. If the modification can be seen as a &ldquo;Derivative Work&rdquo;, you can place it under your commercial/proprietary license. If the modification does not qualify as &ldquo;Derivative Work&rdquo; (e.g., bug fixes, vendor specific annotations), it must remain under Modelica License 2. This means that your Modelica package could be under a commercial/proprietary license, but one or more parts of it are under Modelica License 2. </p>
<h4>Can I distribute a &ldquo;save total model&rdquo; under my commercial/proprietary license, even if classes under Modelica License 2 are included?</h4>
<p>Your classes of the &ldquo;save total model&rdquo; can be distributed under your commercial/proprietary license, but the classes under Modelica License 2 must remain under Modelica License 2. This means you can distribute a &ldquo;save total model&rdquo;, but some parts might be under Modelica License 2. </p>
<h4>Can I distribute a Modelica package (under Modelica License 2) in encrypted form?</h4>
<p>Yes. Note, if the encryption does not allow &ldquo;copying&rdquo; of classes (in to unencrypted Modelica source code), you have to send the Modelica source code of this package to your customer, if he/she wishes it, according to article&nbsp;6. </p>
<h4>Can I distribute an executable under my commercial/proprietary license, if the model from which the executable is generated uses models from a Modelica package under Modelica License 2?</h4>
<p>Yes, according to article 2d), since this is seen as Derivative Work. The reasoning is the following: An executable allows the simulation of a concrete model, whereas models from a Modelica package (without pre-processing, translation, tool run-time library) are not able to be simulated without tool support. By the processing of the tool and by its run-time libraries, significant new functionality is added (a model can be simulated whereas previously it could not be simulated) and functionality available in the package is removed (e.g., to build up a new model by dragging components of the package is no longer possible with the executable). </p>
<h4>Is my modification to a Modelica package (under Modelica License 2) a Derivative Work?</h4>
<p>It is not possible to give a general answer to it. To be regarded as &QUOT;an original work of authorship&QUOT;, a derivative work must be different enough from the original or must contain a substantial amount of new material. Making minor changes or additions of little substance to a preexisting work will not qualify the work as a new version for such purposes. </p>
<p><b></font><font style=\"color: #008000; \">Using or Distributing a Modelica <u>Document</u> under the Modelica License 2</font></b> </p>
<p><font style=\"font-size: 10pt; \">This section is devoted especially for the following applications:</p>
<p>A Modelica tool extracts information out of a Modelica package and presents the result in form of a &ldquo;manual&rdquo; for this package in, e.g., html, doc, or pdf format. </p>
<p>The Modelica language specification is a document defining the Modelica language. It will be licensed under Modelica License 2. </p>
<p>Someone writes a book about the Modelica language and/or Modelica packages and uses information which is available in the Modelica language specification and/or the corresponding Modelica package. </p>
<h4>Can I sell a manual that was basically derived by extracting information automatically from a Modelica package under Modelica License 2 (e.g., a &ldquo;reference guide&rdquo; of the Modelica Standard Library):</h4>
<p>Yes. Extracting information from a Modelica package, and providing it in a human readable, suitable format, like html, doc or pdf format, where the content is significantly modified (e.g. tables with interface information are constructed from the declarations of the public variables) qualifies as Derivative Work and there are no restrictions to charge a fee for Derivative Work under alternative 2d). </p>
<p><b>Can I copy a text passage out of a Modelica document (under Modelica License 2) and use it <u>unmodified</u> in my document (e.g. the Modelica syntax description in the Modelica Specification)?</b></p>
<p>Yes. In case you distribute your document, the copied parts are still under Modelica License 2 and you are not allowed to charge a license fee for this part. You can, of course, charge a fee for the rest of your document. </p>
<p><b>Can I copy a text passage out of a Modelica document (under Modelica License 2) and use it in <u>modified</u> form in my document?</b></p>
<p>Yes, the creation of Derivative Works is allowed. In case the content is significantly modified this qualifies as Derivative Work and there are no restrictions to charge a fee for Derivative Work under alternative 2d). </p>
<h4>Can I sell a printed version of a Modelica document (under Modelica License 2), e.g., the Modelica Language Specification?</h4>
<p>No, if you are not the copyright-holder, since article 2c) does not allow a selling fee for a (in this case physical) copy. However, mere printing and shipping costs may be recovered.</p>

<h4>kC2 = (Vmax/2) / ( -DfG(P) - R * T * ln(2) ) </h4>
<p><br>For example in case of C=AmountOfSolution/(Tau*ActivationPotential) we can rewrite C to ActivationPotential (Be carefull: this energy is not the same as in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrhenius_equation\">Arrhenius equation</a> or in Transition State Theory):</p>
<p>ActivationPotential1 = AmountOfSolution/(Tau*(Vmax/2)) * R * T * ln(2) </p>
<p>ActivationPotential2 = AmountOfSolution/(Tau*(Vmax/2)) * ( -DfG(P) - R * T * ln(2) ) </p>
<p><br>where</p>
<p>AmountOfSolution = MM = 55.508 (for water)</p>
<p>Tau = 1 s (just to be physical unit correct)</p>
<p>DfG(P) = -R*T*50 is Gibbs energy of formation of product (setting negative enough makes second reaction almost irreversible)</p>
<h4>The maximum of the new enzyme kinetics</h4>
<p>The enzymatic rate must have a maximum near of Vmax. </p>
<p>The new maximum is a litle higher: Vmax * (1 + 1/( -uP&deg;/(R*T*ln(2)) - 1) ), for example if -uP&deg;/RT = 50, the new maximum is around 1.014*Vmax, where Vmax is the maximum of Michaelis Menten.</p>
<p>The proof:</p>
<p>We want to sutisfied the following inequality:</p>
<p>-kC2 * (uP&deg; + uE&deg; - uES&deg; + R*T*ln(xP*xE/xES) ) ?=&LT;? Vmax * (1 + 1/( -uP&deg;/(R*T*ln(2)) - 1) )</p>
<p><br>(Vmax/2) * (uP&deg; + uE&deg; - uES&deg; + R*T*ln(xP*xE/xES) ) / ( - uP&deg; - R * T * ln(2) ) ?=&LT;? Vmax*(1 + R*T*ln(2) / ( -uP&deg; - R*T*ln(2)) )</p>
<p>(uP&deg; +<b> </b>R*T*ln(2/x(Km)) + R*T*ln(xP*xE/xES) ) ?=&LT;? 2*( - uP&deg; - R * T * ln(2) ) + 2*R*T*ln(2)</p>
<p>R*T*ln(xP*xE/xES) ?=&LT;? - uP&deg; - R*T*ln(2/x(Km)) </p>
<p>xP*xE/xES ?=&LT;? exp((- uP&deg; - R*T*ln(2/x(Km))/(R*T))</p>
<p>The equality is the equation of the equilibrium: xP*xE/xES = exp((- uP&deg; - uE&deg; + uES&deg; )/(R*T)) = exp((- uP&deg; - R*T*ln(2/x(Km))/(R*T))</p>
<p>If the equilibrium of the reaction is reached only by forward rate then xP*xE/xES must be less than the dissociation constant.</p>
<h4>The increasing of the amount of the enzyme</h4>
<p>In the situation of doubled amount of enzyme should double also the maximal speed of the reaction, shouldn&apos;t?</p>

<p><br>To understand the model is necessary to study the principles of MWC allosteric transitions first published by </p>

<p><br>In short it is about binding oxygen to hemoglobin.</p>
<p>Oxgen are driven by its partial pressure using clock source - from very little pressure to pressure of 10kPa.</p>
<p>(Partial pressure of oxygen in air is the air pressure multiplied by the fraction of the oxygen in air.)</p>
<p>Hemoglobin was observed (by Perutz) in two structuraly different forms R and T.</p>
<p>These forms are represented by blocks T0..T4 and R0..R4, where the suffexed index means the number of oxygen bounded to the form.</p>
<p><br>In equilibrated model can be four chemical reactions removed and the results will be the same, but dynamics will change a lot. ;)</p>
<p>If you remove the quaternaryForm1,quaternaryForm2,quaternaryForm3,quaternaryForm4 then the model in equilibrium will be exactly the same as in MWC article.</p>

<h4>n = x &middot; n(solution) = &int; MolarFlow</h4>
<p>where n is amount of the substance and x is mole fraction.</p>
<p>The main class from &ldquo;Chemical&rdquo; package is called &QUOT;Substance&QUOT;. It has one chemical connector, where chemical potential and molar flow is presented. An amount of solute &QUOT;n&QUOT; is accumulated by molar flow inside an instance of this class. In the default setting the amount of solution &QUOT;n(solution)&QUOT; is set to 55.6 as amount of water in one liter, so in this setting the concentration of very diluted solution in pure water at &ldquo;mol/L&rdquo; has the same value as the amount of substance at &ldquo;mol&rdquo;. But in the advanced settings the default amount of solution can be changed by parameter or using solution port to connect with solution. The molar flow at the port can be also negative, which means that the solute leaves the Substance instance.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>The recalculation between mole fraction, molarity and molality can be written as follows:</p>
<p>x = n/n(solution) = b * m(solvent)/n(solution) = c * V(solution)/n(solution)</p>
<p>where m(solvent) is mass of solvent, V(solution) is volume of solution, b=n/m(solvent) is molality of the substance, c=n/V(solution) is molarity of the substance.</p>
<p>If the amount of solution is selected to the number of total solution moles per one kilogram of solvent then the values of x will be the same as molality.</p>
<p>If the amount of solution is selected to the number of total solution moles in one liter of solution then the values of x will be the same as molarity.</p>
<p><br><br>Definition of electro-chemical potential:</p>
<h4>u(x,T,V) = u&deg;(T) + R*T*ln(gamma*x) + z*F*v</h4>
<h4>u&deg;(T) = DfG(T) = DfH - T * DfS</h4>
<p>where</p>
<p>x .. mole fraction of the substance in the solution</p>
<p>T .. temperature in Kelvins</p>
<p>v .. relative eletric potential of the solution</p>
<p>z .. elementary charge of the substance (like -1 for electron, +2 for Ca^2+)</p>
<p>R .. gas constant</p>
<p>F .. Faraday constant</p>
<p>gamma .. activity coefficient</p>
<p>u&deg;(T) .. chemical potential of pure substance</p>
<p>DfG(T) .. free Gibbs energy of formation of the substance at current temperature T. </p>
<p>DfH .. free enthalpy of formation of the substance</p>
<p>DfS .. free entropy of formation of the substance </p>
<p><br>Be carefull, DfS is not the same as absolute entropy of the substance S&deg; from III. thermodinamic law! It must be calculated from tabulated value of DfG(298.15 K) and DfH as DfS=(DfH - DfG)/298.15. </p>
